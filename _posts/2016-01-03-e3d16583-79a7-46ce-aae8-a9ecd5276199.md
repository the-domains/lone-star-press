Pantheon \#2 

An unknown narrator tells the story of Death Boy, the kid who disintegrates heroes with a glance. When the heroes trap the kid in the depths of the Grand Canyon, they launch a full assault that results in casualties. Beaten, they fall back and consider their options, when Dr. Odd comes up with a theory that just might work. 

Artists- Bill Willingham, Mike Leeke, Bill Williams, Brad Thomte
