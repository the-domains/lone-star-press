The Ballad of Comics Journal \#278

Gather around, younglings. Once upon a time, before the internet, there were these things called magazines. Printed on the mangled skin of dead trees, they were filled with yesterdays news and long boring hard-to-read features. Still, we loved them because they saved us a ton of credits on batteries. And we could read them in the tub. 

One of my favorite magazines was The Comics Journal. When a comic creator was interviewed in The Comics Journal, it indicated that he or she had hit a certain career level, a milestone. The mere fact that their name was on the cover showed the editor's hope that their collected wisdom and tales of battle would drive sales. 

My friend Bill Willingham was one such titan. He contacted me to inform me he would be telling the old storeys and showing his scars in that prestigious magazine. He needed but one thing from me, my skill with an electronic crayon box that would one day become Photoshop 100\. I happily agreed and after a couple of rounds of corrections, I sent him a representation of him in all of his glory in Old Binary. My little mark, the 'Zed', is on the lower right.

The printed version is atop this scroll, and my original below.
