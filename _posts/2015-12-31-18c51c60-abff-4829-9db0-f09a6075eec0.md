Unused SideChicks Cover- featuring Abessa
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/206315221893c320f28bcbd18ab8f86102209417.png)

This image was penciled by the lovely and talented Walter Geovani and inked by me, your host, Bill Williams. I had the cover done before I realized I had no home for it, but that is a story for another day.
