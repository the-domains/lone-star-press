JOE THUNDER is a super-strong, soft-hearted hero of the masses. After a street brawl, he is in a dark jail cell and and he refuses to leave on bail. After settling his nerves with a glass of milk, Joe tells his story to Miss Porter who has to somehow clear Joe's name and restore his confidence. 

Writer/ Artist- Bob Hall
