Pantheon \#13 

The conclusion! A great team of heroes becomes fractured on the question of what to do after all of their opponents have been defeated. Daedalus wants to rule the world for the benefit of the masses and Dynasty assembles a team to defend people's right to govern themselves. 

Artists- Bill Willingham, Mike Leeke, Bill Williams, Brad Thomte
