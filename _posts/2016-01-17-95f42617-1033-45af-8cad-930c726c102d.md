Ex Parte \#2 

Alan Adams is a professor at a sleepy little college in upstate New York. What could Janine Porters possibly want with him? And how does she know all about his alter-ego, The American Athlete? Alan wants answers, but Janine is more curious about his career and his personal life. With reality shifting around them, Janine goads Alan into revealing the dark secret behind his "retirement." You won't guess the surprise ending of "Big Man on Campus!" 

Artists- Bill Williams, Koi Turnbull, Rus Sever, Tom Mullin, Thom Zahler, Doctor Martin Thomas
