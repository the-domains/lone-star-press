In the conclusion of 'Just Business', Shawn walks into a bar. Full of super-villains. She picks out a guy and takes him into the alley to beat some information out of him. That's not how super-heroics usually go, but that's how super-bodyguards get it done.

Artists- Francisco Rodriguez de la Fuente, Robb Phipps, Bill Williams, Thom Zahler

Characters- Shawn Collier (TOMBOY), Melania Sophronia (ABESSA), Sandstone, Ruby
