Once upon a time, I was asked to create a webcomic for a site that hosts comic book and pop culture podcasts. So, I put together an instructional webcomic that was full of tips that would help people hone their skills. The tips were all over the creator's map, covering the writing and the penciling and the lettering and the inking. I got eight of the half pages finished and then had a falling out with my contact at the site. 

Judging by the page views, nobody saw the strip the first time around and the unfinished work sat in a dropbox folder. With the end of SideChicks just around the corner, I wondered what to do next. My job as an editor at 1First Comics is wrapping up and while I have people promising me freelance work, you know how that can go. 

So, I've dusted off the instructional webcomic which is called Speed Lines. It is running as a webcomic over on Tapastic where I have a few other strips posted. There is a digital version in the works as well. For that digital release, I have created a few pages of tips that will be exclusive to that version. Here's one now.
